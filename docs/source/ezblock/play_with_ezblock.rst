Play with Ezblock
===========================


**Ezblock** is a development platform developed by SunFounder designed for beginners to lower the barriers to getting started with Raspberry Pi. 
It has two programming languages: Graphical and Python, and available on almost all different types of devices.
With Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support, you can download code, remote control a Raspberry Pi, on Ezblock Studio.

Ezblock has been upgraded to the third version. Compared with the Bluetooth communication of Ezblock 2, Ezblock 3 uses Websocket to communicate, which is much faster.

So Ezblock 3 is used here.

**Projects**

Here, we show you the projects of playing PiSloth on Ezblock Studio. If you are new to these, you can refer to the code images inside each project to program, and can learn the use of blocks according to TIPS.

If you don't want to write these projects one by one, we have uploaded them to Ezblock Studio's Examples page and you can run them directly or edit them and run them later.
