.. note::

    You can download and print the `PDF Cartoon Mask <https://github.com/sunfounder/sf-pdf/tree/master/prop_card/cartoon_mask>`_ for your PiSloth.

**TIPS**

In addition to having PiSloth play sound effects and speak, it can also play set background music, and the volume of the background music can be adjusted (0%-100%).

Repeat block can help you execute the same code multiple times to reduce code size.

**EXAMPLE**

.. note::
    * You can write the program according to the following picture, please refer to the tutorial: :ref:`ezblock:create_project_latest`

    * Or find the code with the same name on the Examples page of the EzBlock Studio and click Run or Edit directly.


The whole dance is divided into 2 parts, and PiSloth will finish these 2 parts with the music. If you don't pause the code, it will repeat the dance.
