  You can download and print the `PDF Cartoon Mask <https://github.com/sunfounder/sf-pdf/tree/master/prop_card/cartoon_mask>`_ for your PiSloth.

**TIPS**

You may want to simplify your program with Variable. For example, when you have multiple functions that need to read the obstacle distance, you donâ€™t need to read the value for each function, just load the value into a variable and use it multiple times.

Click the **Create variable** button on the **Variables** category to create a variable named distance.

You can use this block to set up an endless loop.

This is a block that jumps out of the loop, and it has two options and can be only used within a loop.


* **break out**: Jump out of the entire loop.
* **continue with next interation**: Jump out of the current loop and enter the next loop.

**EXAMPLE**

After the code is run, PiSloth will continuously detect the distance of the obstacle, when the distance is between 5 and 40, PiSloth will make a roaring sound and rush forward; when the distance of the obstacle is less than 5, PiSloth will stop.
